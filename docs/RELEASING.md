# Releasing D2-ui packages

## TL;DR

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn release
$ lerna publish
```

## Step 0: Before starting

Make sure that you have run the `install` process to make sure that
everything works as intended. Also double check the example application
that everything looks OK.

## Step 1: Building

There is a shortcut command to run the `bootstrap`, `build`,
`build:umd`, and `test`, commands in sequence:

```
yarn release
```

## Step 3: Publish

Familiarise yourself with [Lerna](http://lernajs.io/) before proceeding.

You will need it installed globally.

Use the `updated` and `diff` commands to get an idea of what Lerna thinks should be updated.

```
$ lerna updated     # used by publish to determine changes

$ lerna diff        # used internally to diff against the last released tag and
                    # prints the code changes which is useful for determining semver
```

To avoid creating tags, pushing them, etc. only to fail on the actual
publishing to NPM make sure you are logged in:

```
$ yarn login
```

Proceed with the `publish` command:

```
$ lerna publish
```

Lerna will proceed to attempt to figure out which packages have changed
(using `updated` internally), their dependencies, along with any
transitive dependencies.

It will then ask you to specify the new versions.

At this point you need to have an idea about if you have introduced
**breaking changes** (major), a new **feature** (minor), or just
**fixes** (patch).

### Example `publish` output

In this example it was decided to bump `@dhis2/d2-ui-core` to a new
minor version because it introduced a new feature which is backwards compatible.

It also included a bugfix to `@dhis2/d2-ui-favorites-dialog`, but since
that package depends on the core package already, only a patch bump was
necessary.

All other packages are changed as they depend on the core package, and
they will automatically be bumped to the new version of the core
library, automatically keeping them in sync. Since we only bump the
patch version of the core package, it should be safe to just bump the
patch version for the dependants as well.

Note that Lerna did not publish the packages which are marked as
`private` even though they are listed under changes. Lerna still updated
the dependencies of these packages however, which is why they are listed
as changed.

We use this fact to ignore certain packages, either because they
shouldn't be published (`example-cra`) or because they are deprecated
(`@dhis2/d2-ui-favorites-menu`).
