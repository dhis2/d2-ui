## Introduction

D2-UI is a user interface component library for developing
[DHIS2](http://www.dhis2.org) applications. The core development team
uses and maintains these components to ensure visual consistency between
DHIS2 web applications.

## Structure

This is a [monorepo](docs/monorepo.md) comprised of many packages which
are individually published to [NPM](https://npmjs.com) using
[Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

See [packages](https://github.com/dhis2/d2-ui/blob/master/packages) to
see what components are available.

## The example application

In [examples](https://github.com/dhis2/d2-ui/blob/master/examples) you
will find an application bootstrapped with
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) which
demonstrates how one consumes the components d2-ui provides.

## Getting started

In the d2-ui root directory:

```
yarn install
yarn bootstrap
yarn watch
```

In the
[examples/create-react-app](https://github.com/dhis2/d2-ui/blob/master/examples/create-react-app)
subdirectory:

```
yarn start
```

Now you are able to change any component in
[packages/](https://github.com/dhis2/d2-ui/blob/master/packages) and the
changes will be reflected live in the example application.

Too do more complex lerna operations you need to learn
[Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). See e.g. the `--scope`
parameter.
